      Hey there.

      This is an archival page for the contents of a brief case found at
      <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/aLXFzJdD6sW5CPZ78">
        40.7265° N, 73.9815° W Earth.

      Briefcase was found at 11:41AM October 25, 2148 by a volunteer at Tompkins
      Square Park.
      <br />

      Briefcase is assumed to date back to early 2000s — most likely the 2020s.
      Relics belonged to a student in her early twenties.

      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBL">speaker.</a>
      <br />
      <br />
      Since the date of initial discovery, additional shirts owned by same
      individual have been found in nearby locations.

      This archival site is an effort in part of a larger collective to document
      vintage pieces before synthetic methods of production became the standard.
      <br />
      <br />
      T-shirts have been cataloged based on their material, print, and
      production origin.
      <br />
      <br />
      All shirts are made of non-synthetic materials, depict images of
      animals/environments local to Earth, and provide us background on country
      specific traits regarding production and culture.
